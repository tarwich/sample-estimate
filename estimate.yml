                    A username field and a password field. The password field
                    should cover the input characters with asterisks. The
                    username field should be a regular text field.

                    When the login button is clicked, the user information will
                    be sent to the server. The server will hash the password and
                    look for a user record which matches the username and the
                    hashed password. If the user is not found, then it will
                    return an error. If the username or password are missing,
                    then it will return an error. If the username or password
                    are not acceptable values, then it will return user not
                    found.

                    The form should support showing an error message for when
                    the user or password are incorrect.
            Signup Form:
              text:
                A form to allow the user to sign up for the service. This form
                should allow for displaying an error message.

                Username Field:
                  hours: 3
                  text:
                    A simple text field to allow entering in a username. This
                    field should support error states and an error message. When
                    typing in this field, queries should be run in the background
                    to ensure that the specified username is not already taken,
                    and if it is, then an error state should be shown on the form
                    to prevent the user from having to fill out the entire form
                    just to discover that their username is already taken.

                  text:
                    This should be a two-field combination that allows entering
                    a password and confirming that password. The fields should
                    support error states and should show an error message as
                    well. Errors should be shown if the password does not meet
                    the minimum requirements, or does not match the confirmation
                    password. If the password field or confirmation fields are
                    blank, then they should not show an error state for not
                    matching -- only for not meeting the minimum requirements.

                    This button should be automatically disabled and subdued if
                    the form has any errors on it, or if any required field is
                    left blank. Clicking this button submits the signup
                    information to the server. The server should re-validate the
                    validity of the username and password, and should send back
                    an error if they are invalid. The error should be specific.

                        disabled and subdued, if any part of the form is blank
                        or invalid. When clicked, the button should show a
                        loading state and be disabled until the form is
                        submitted.

                      text:
                        When the reset password form is submitted to the server,
                        the server should check to see if the user is already
                        has a valid reset token. If they do, it should not
                        change that token, as this could be used as an attack
                        vector to prevent a user from ever changing their
                        password.

                        If there is no reset token, then a new one should be
                        generated. This token could have a hash of the date, the
                        e-mail, and the current hashed password of the user.

                        The generated token should be generated and e-mailed to
                        the user, allowing them to reset their password.

                    This is the form that allows a user to reset their password.
                    They access this form by clicking a valid reset password
                    link from their e-mail. If the reset password link is
                    invalid or expired, then this form allows them to enter a
                    reset password code e-mailed to them in order to enable
                    the form.

                        When a user has submitted a reset password request, the

                        the passwords do not match, or are not valid. If either
                        field is blank, then the passwords do not need to match.

                        If any error occures, the error should be returned to
                        the client.
